# Data Analysis and Numerical Techniques 

This is a repo of my scientific computational records.

Here you'll find code for the following:

 - Basic data analysis and statistics (linear least-squares regression)
 - Data fitting and analysis techniques (linear and non-linear least-squares regression, model fitting, correlation and interpolation for analysis of data sets.)
 - Statistical hypothesis testing
 - Graph plotting (with error bars and etc..)

Code written in python (libraries: numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy etc..)
